# MCRITweb

MCRITweb is a Flask-based user interface for the [MinHash-based Code Recognition & Investigation Toolkit (MCRIT)](https://github.com/danielplohmann/mcrit).  
MCRITweb has been developed by Daniel Enders, Manuel Blatt, and Daniel Plohmann.

## Installation

We highly recommend using the dockerized deployment available at [docker-mcrit](https://github.com/danielplohmann/docker-mcrit).

If you instead want to go for a direct installation, a few dependencies have to be installed.  
First, ensure that Python 3.8+ is available, then simply use pip to cover the requirements:
```bash
# install python and MCRIT dependencies
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Obviously, also make sure that the backend [MCRIT](https://github.com/danielplohmann/mcrit) is fully installed, configured, and running.


## Usage

### Dockerized Usage

We highly recommend to use the fully packaged [docker-mcrit](https://github.com/danielplohmann/docker-mcrit) for trivial deployment and usage.  
First and foremost, this will ensure that you have fully compatible versions across all components.

### Standalone Usage

If you instead want to run MCRITweb as a standalone tool, the following steps will enable this:

Running flask commands requires you to set environment variables in your shell:  
`$ source ./flask_env.sh`

before the first usage, create an empty database:   
`$ flask init-db`

and then to run MCRITweb, execute:  
`$ flask run`

Note that most functionality of MCRITweb will only work if an MCRIT backend is configured and available.
